Development Guildlines
----------------------

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.

- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. 
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
